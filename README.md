# Ratlapator

VIN project, 2022

This is a project that "simulates" rat movement on canvas with painted paws = a rat art.
As a rat owner myself, I took this opportunity to create an app that will allow you to
make your own rat art without rats, paints and messy bathtub. Enjoy :)



## Usage/Examples

**Create your rat art here:**

http://isaranov.pythonanywhere.com/

!! might not work properly on anything else than Chrome !!


**How to use:**

- Set as many colors as you like, but you have to set at least one color. Color amounts are in range from 0 to 255 and correspond to the level of transparency.
- Set rats speed, size and a number of steps.
- Submit the rat and let it run.

With each move the rat's color amount gets lower, so low amounts of color
will run out more quickly. 

Sometimes the rat gets stuck in the corner or sides, please try submiting more times before
losing hope .
